Statla
======
__Statla__ is an easy-to-use library for parallel computation of basic statistics like _mean_,
_variance_, _standard deviation_, _skewness_ and _kurtosis_. It also contains basic sequential
implementation of the aforementioned descriptors. So, you can get statistical calculation from
your collections *in the blink of an eye*. It has been designed to allow statistical computing
of new elements incrementally, avoiding to recompute again the elements already computed.

This library is based on the following papers:

1.   [Computing Higher-Order Moments Online by Timothy B. Terriberry](http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/notes/homs.html)
2.   [Formulas for Robust, One-Pass Parallel Computation of Covariances and Arbitrary-Order Statistical Moments by Philippe Pebay [Peb08]](http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2008/086212.pdf)
3.   [Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products by B. P. Welford [Wel62]](http://zach.in.tu-clausthal.de/teaching/info_literatur/Welford.pdf)
